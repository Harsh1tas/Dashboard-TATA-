   a dashboard is a user interface that provides a visual summary of key information and metrics, often in the form of charts, graphs, and tables. Dashboards are designed to give users a quick and easy way to monitor and understand important data at a glance. They are widely used in business intelligence (BI) and data analytics to track performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions.
